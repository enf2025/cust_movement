# cust_movement
a compleatly custom, server-side movement controller. unfinished but working. unfixable one tick delay :/

makes every player ride another entity with movement controlled by a script
script at data\code\function\movement_controller\main.mcfunction

i don't yet delete the entities when the player leaves

also theres one-tick delay bc it's all calculated server side and i think ping makes it worse and its annoying so like
thats why this is unfinished
